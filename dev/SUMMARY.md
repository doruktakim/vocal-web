## Purpose
Local developer utilities and experiments.

## How it works
- `test_element_matching.py` loads recorded AX snapshots and validates the improved matching heuristics (input fields, date buttons, action buttons) against human/agent recordings in `docs/correctActions/`.

## Typical use
Run it manually to sanity-check matcher updates without needing the full agent stack.
