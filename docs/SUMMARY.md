# docs/

## Purpose
Project documentation and supporting artifacts for prompts, security, and recorded behavior.

## How it works
- `prompts/` contains the interpreter prompt template used by the LLM fallback.
- `security/` documents TLS/HTTPS setup and production guidance.
- `correctActions/` stores recorded agent/human AX runs used for matcher validation.

## Who uses it
Contributors and testers who need configuration guidance or ground-truth recordings.
