# docs/correctActions/

## Purpose
Reference recordings of “correct” agent and human behaviors for evaluating AX matching.

## How it works
- Subfolders contain JSON timelines of AX snapshots and action traces captured during agent or human runs.
- These recordings are consumed by the developer test script in `dev/test_element_matching.py`.
